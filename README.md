# staticrelay

StaticRelay is a minimalist PlanetPlanet clone written in Python3.  It's an RSS aggregator that takes a list of feed URLs and generates an aggregated content view in static html.

StaticRelay wasn't designed to be written well, it was designed to be implemented quickly, so, if you have improvements, pull requests are welcome.

# Instructions
set up a cron job that kicks off a script that does the following:

cd to the directory
execute grab_feeds.py

Set the cron to execute at your desired update frequency
