                <p><p>After some review of the dual licensing of LFS, it&#8217;s occured to me I need more segmentation in my planning for how to get to a new distro that I can offer commercial support for and distribute for commercial use.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the core reason for doing this, but, I&#8217;d like to be compensated eventually for all the hard work, and perhaps hire people and build a company around it.</p>
<p>I think in order to get there, I&#8217;ll need to make some pivots on approach on this.</p>
<p>To get around the non-commercial shit in LFS&#8217; licensing, I&#8217;ll probably, once I get to a releasable state, release this build as a project called &#8220;ALFS- NG&#8221; that inherits the crap they snuck in there and have DHLP be a non-derivative rewrite.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still thinking about it, but, if that&#8217;s the direction, once ALFS-NG is good to a certain point, I&#8217;ll be able to apply what I&#8217;ve learned to Dark Horse Linux.  I feel as I&#8217;m going through this process that LFS has many, many unnecessary steps to do something like this.</p>
<p>I may even do a second build with one of the RPM variants of LFS/BLFS to get an idea of what I&#8217;m in for in terms of introducing binary package management cleanly.</p></p>

<p>At this point there&#8217;s a sysroot, you can enter the chroot with `make enter_chroot`, and browse around after getting through a `make all`.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll probably see in the git commit logs for Pyrois that I&#8217;m adding units to &#8220;master.plan&#8221; and testing there, before moving them to &#8220;stage4.plan&#8221; after they&#8217;re worked out.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s by design.  I use &#8220;make backup&#8221; and &#8220;make restore&#8221; all through the process as this allows me to work out kinks in the scripts before vetting them and moving them over to their &#8220;forever homes&#8221;.</p></p>

                <p><p>It&#8217;s occured to me that even someone technical may see all the movement here and just not really understand what this project is, so, I thought I&#8217;d write a brief to catch folks up to speed.</p>



<h2>So, what&#8217;s the Dark Horse Linux Project?</h2>



<p>The Dark Horse Linux Project (DHLP) is a new Linux Distribution.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve likely heard of Linux, already.  What you may not know is that the term &#8220;Linux&#8221; actually includes many different kinds of operation systems.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what an Operating System is, you may have heard of Microsoft Windows.  You get a little compact disc and install it on the machine, and it gives you things to click on and do your work, and, for the more nerdly, to write your own software or host your own services.</p>



<p>In the Linux space, the term &#8220;Linux&#8221; is really just referring to the kernel itself and in some crowds includes the gnu toolchain as well.  What you might not know is that there are many providers of unique operating sytems that fall under the category of &#8220;Linux&#8221;.  Each of those providers gives you a different variation of what Linux is and comes with different pieces that make up the operating system.  Here are some famous examples:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fedora Linux</li>



<li>RedHat Linux</li>



<li>Ubuntu</li>



<li>Debian</li>



<li>Slackware</li>



<li>CentOS</li>



<li>Mint</li>



<li>Arch Linux</li>
</ul>



<p>You&#8217;ve likely already heard of these, and there are lots to choose from, each with unique properties.  RedHat Linux and Ubuntu, for example, have attributes that make them prime selection candidates for an enterprise computing environment (think of servers, cloud, etc).</p>



<p>Indeed, the various communities surrounding Linux are myriad, and this diversity is critical to the continued existence of the Free and Open Source Systems movement.  </p>



<p>However, there are some complex problems, and always have been in those communities.  Some can&#8217;t be addressed simply by the introduction of a new contender, but some issues can.</p>



<h2>Diversity in the Linux Ecosystem</h2>



<p>If those communities were to homogenize it would become vulnerable to interference from entities that sell proprietary systems &#8212; all of which stand to gain a great deal financially from the elimination or control of a sizable portion of Linux communities and their internal development pipelines. The best thing that can happen for those cooperative adversaries is the unification of all Linux distribution communities into 3-5 distributions, as this would allow them to steer those projects into directions that are financially beneficial for those companies, but, not so great for us.</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/new-distros-2023/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the latest upcoming Linux distributions for this year</a>.  If you go through the list, you&#8217;ll see an exemplification of one of the issues this project exists to address.  Every single one of these new Linux distributions is, in fact, not a new Linux distribution at all.  They are rebranded releases of already existing Linux distributions.</p>



<p>In fact, if you look closer at the &#8220;famous&#8221; list I provided earlier, you&#8217;ll notice a few oddities that parallel this:  CentOS is a rebranded RedHat.  Ubuntu is a rebranded Debian.  Mint is a rebranded Ubuntu (twice over on that one!).  </p>



<p>In the list I linked to for this year&#8217;s new contenders, you&#8217;ll see that about half of them are based on Arch Linux, while the rest are based on others on the list I typed out above.</p>



<p>Almost all &#8220;truly new&#8221; or &#8220;parent leaf&#8221; distributions die out pretty soon after release.</p>



<p>Of those that don&#8217;t, there are serious issues that serve as barriers to widespread adoption, such as a non-standard libc variant, or using busybox as the userland toolchain, or missing multilib support, preventing a desktop market, etc.  They have serious missing pieces that Linux communities expect to see.</p>



<p>That is a large part of why this project exists.  </p>



<h2>Most Established Distro Communities are Toxic</h2>



<p>The other part of it is that, as someone who&#8217;s been participating in the Linux community since the mid-90s, I&#8217;ve found that the non-commercial communities have categorically toxic cultures.  I had been involved in and even led numerous campaigns to try to address that over the years, and was seeing some progress, but I found that after all that work, one kind of toxicity was simply being exchanged for another.  I wanted to create something better.  So I decided to.</p>



<p>While researching this issue quite a few years ago, I came across a project called &#8220;Linux From Scratch&#8221;.  This is such an impressive project!  They tediously list out, step by step, a process to create a bespoke installation to their own specifications of a new Linux system.  It&#8217;s not quite a distribution, as there is no downloadable OS, but a set of instructions that can easily serve a large part in the genesis of a fully equipped new parent leaf Linux distribution with all of the pieces those users look for.</p>



<p>When I said that the process is tedious, I mean that in every sense of the word.  It&#8217;s alot of work and takes a lot of skill to do it by hand.  So, I got to thinking:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What if I unitized all the steps that create a new distribution into separate automations represented in an object notation that allowed me to automate the entire process with selectable components?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The thinking behind this is that this would allow more people to have access to the tools they need to create fully capable Linux distributions, and that if this took on momentum it could help to facilitate the diversity of the Linux ecosystem, either directly, or by inspiring a competitor project who can do it better.</p>



<p>There was the ALFS project (Automated Linux From Scratch) but it had gone stale and didn&#8217;t, in my impression, fully unitize the steps &#8212; though it <em>did</em> automate them.  Even if it had, it did not appear to be terribly receptive to customization, and the project appeared to be abandoned.  I believe it still is.</p>



<p>So, I probed around for a few years, knowing I was about to start building a new Linux distribution.</p>



<p>Initially I was going to call it SURRO Linux, as I was trying to figure out how to create a new &#8220;parent leaf&#8221; linux distribution anyway, and, there was initially some interest.  I created an IRC channel for the project, and a couple of the LFS crew even helped out.  Until&#8230;I joined their channel to ask some questions about making some changes to the compile options.</p>



<p>It turned out, someone from the Ubuntu Linux community had figured out a way to gain rank in the LFS project and my access to LFS resources was immediately terminated by that person when I explained the scale of what I was attempting to do, despite being a year into the process already with another LFS developer.</p>



<p>As a result of Matt&#8217;s deliberate efforts to starve the project of critical resources, though, it inspired me to create an entirely new thing:  A distro that helps other distros be created, as an example of how this should work &#8212; both technically and at a human level.  </p>



<p>So I guess you could say, in a way, Matt played an important role in the creation of SURRO Linux by demonstrating that the problems I was concerned about on many levels were not just further along than I believed, but closing the gaps on one of the last bastion projects in the F/OSS world that gauranteed the perpetuity of the Linux operating system by facilitating diversity&#8211; by infecting the LFS project with his presence and compromising the decision authority in it in order to prevent the genesis of a product intended to compete with Canonical&#8217;s (Ubuntu).  </p>



<p>I recall being profoundly disappointed at this turn of events, as, I had been learning so much from the LFS project&#8217;s other members, quite quickly, and am immensely grateful of the feedback they were providing in the early stages before that.  I will always be appreciative of that learning period.</p>



<p>Galvanized in determination, over the years since, and in between other projects, I picked at SURRO Linux, the hard way, and had to develop some custom tools to implement what I could extract from the LFS documentation.</p>



<p>You may have seen some mentions of these.  Rex.  Examplar.</p>



<p>Examplar is the original name of the tool.  It was recently rebranded as Rex.  Rex is an automation tool that reads a libary of json objects, each representing the necessary parts of a largely idempotent automation.    It then reads another json file whose contents represent steps in a plan to carry out, which reference the automations in the library.  This method allows me to do large chains of automations with each step in a fully controlled context, including environment, whether a pty is used, what user the automation runs as, as it captures STDOUT and STDERR of the automation to log files for review to ensure the build is clean without having to stop.</p>



<p>After some time, I ran into a technical barrier with Rex that prevented the continuation of the development of SURRO Linux until it was unkinked.  I worked on other projects and campaigns for a while to get my head fresh on it.</p>



<p>Once that issue was finally solved, enough time had passed to where I needed to refresh the codebase used as the solution involved a full rewrite of Rex.</p>



<p>So, I renamed it to Dark Horse Linux and started over.  With the new tools in place I was able to do what had previously taken 2 years to develop in just a few days, and now there seems to be some momentum behind it.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;m hoping to have it generate a bootable image by July of this year finally, though, it won&#8217;t really be the release of Dark Horse Linux, so much as a snapshot of a working system for others to borrow from before I move on to building out an installer image.  That&#8217;ll just be when the real work starts to build out the installer and package management infrastructure.  Honestly, with my workload at my dayjobs, I think July is an ambitious target.  Walking through LFS is only of moderate difficulty, automating the steps and extracting enough to create a new Distribution is another matter entirely.  This is all just one person currently.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen some mention of a repo called &#8220;Pyrois&#8221;.  Pyrois is a Rex project that will compile the install images related to Dark Horse Linux and is where the majority of the work takes place.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m always receptive to people participating, and if you&#8217;d like to participate, feel free to email me at &#8220;&#8220;&#8220;`<a href="mailto:dhlp@silogroup.org">dhlp@silogroup.org</a></p>



<p>Along the way, many things happened since I initially announced SURRO Linux was going to be a thing.  My Dad died early on.  I ran into access issues researching what I was trying to do.  I have other projects.  I have a whole other career besides this and the project is self-funded currently.  I was involved into two activist campaigns in the open source community (RMS, Freenode).  My personal blog has more details about those, though, I just wanted to make it clear that this is a slowly moving project for now &#8212; though I do have high hopes for it.</p></p>

                <p><p>At this point, DHLP is compiling up to LFS CH. 8.</p>



<p>This is the point where it finally starts to get &#8220;real&#8221;, as we&#8217;ve finished the compilation of all the temporary tools and are starting to build the &#8220;real&#8221; permanent system.</p>



<p>This is also an exciting part because I got to introduce the first of those classic ncurses dialog prompts.</p>



<p>Stay tuned.</p></p>

                <p><p>So, as it&#8217;s nearing a bootable ISO, some stages of development seem to be forming in terms of expectations.</p>



<h2>A Whole Image</h2>



<p>First, I&#8217;ll end up with something very close to an LFS build that needs alot of work to get installed onto a different system.</p>



<h2>Gentooesque Genesis, Slackwaresque Form</h2>



<p>Then, I&#8217;ll end up with some kind of installer that seems like it will work very similarly to slackware&#8217;s and FreeBSD&#8217;s installer, but compiled in a very gentoo kind of way beforehand.  I see this piece taking quite a bit of time to get through if I pursue that as far would be expected.  The important pieces will be drive formatting/partitioning dialogs and tools, bootloader installation.  Copying to the mounts appropriately etc.</p>



<h2>A Familiar Set of Tools</h2>



<p>Some ways after that, unless it doesn&#8217;t work the way I expect, I&#8217;ll probably pivot to an rpm-based system that, a certain point after librpm is compiled, binary packages are downloaded that replace the packages already compiled and installed.  Systemd.  Firewalld.  Then the decision needs made about whether I&#8217;ll use DNF or an inhouse built package manager.   One drawback I see about this is, some users will probably use rpms from SUSE and RH and Rocky and Fedora and run into build compatibility problems.  On the other hand, some of the time it&#8217;ll actually work with a little tweaking of binaries.  On the other hand, using a familiar ecosystem for the core pieces of the system will bring with them the stability those pieces are known for, they are tried and true, and will be already familiar by many, many users.  So there&#8217;s a tradeoff to consider.  It also prevents me from having to reinvent package management.  Life&#8217;s just too short and I&#8217;m one person.</p>



<h2>On Package Management</h2>



<div class="wp-block-cover aligncenter"><span class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img alt="" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-1881" height="1024" src="https://phanes.silogroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DALLÂ·E-2023-02-22-02.39.45-red-horseman-of-revelations-charcoal-armor-1024x1024.png" width="1024" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">It&#8217;s dangerous to go alone.  </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Take this.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Leaving it without package management is just not an option in the currrent security theatre.  Modern systems need not just build systems for distributable packages but patching systems built in with pipelines established for those patches to reduce overhead.  Patches that are free, open source, and available in other package-based distributions.  In some cases, with associated CVEs.  This will require lots of infrastructure to do sustainably even if I weren&#8217;t just one person.</p>



<p>I think what I ought to do is find some way to faciliate that infrastructure, designed in such a way where it waits for contributors to do the things.  So, if someone thinks its too slow, a pull request from a stranger (or a familiar maintainer, even) gets submitted so that I don&#8217;t have to do the work.  It gets reviewed and merged.  The more people involved the better, but, it /could/ work with one person, just very slowly.</p></p>

                <h5><a target="_blank" href="https://phanes.silogroup.org/musings-on-a-code-of-conduct/">Phanes' Canon: Musings on a Code of Conduct</a></h5>
                <p><p>I don&#8217;t even like the concept of a Code of Conduct in any technical project.</p>



<p>But, people are jerks.  I acknowledge that you need one these days to provide a groundwork of acceptable behaviour because not everyone can just be a decent adult on their own, but may have good technical contributions to provide.</p>



<p>That said, every implementation of a Code of Conduct that I have ever seen has been so permeated with overreach that it should be set on fire and abandoned before routing out everyone who created that overreach and removing any control they have over that community.</p>



<p>I personally view most major F/OSS projects&#8217; CoC to be created for the sole purpose of preparing a community and its culture for hijacking by corporate sponsors.  </p>



<p>It ends up being a device they can use to bump out the people that won&#8217;t meet their sponsor&#8217;s goals while creating gaps to fill by the people they have selected to steer the project towards those corporate interests.</p>



<p>This practice is, in my opinion, so pervasive that in aggregate, I see it could eventually create an insincere and purely aesthetic dystopia where people will eventually have to resort to whispering in soundproof rooms to express themselves to avoid being targeted unless they abandon their entire personalities&#8211; their careers, their families, project positions at jeopardy&#8211; all depending on the scale of money behind the project and who the sponsors are.  People will comply with the narrative or they will &#8220;become bad people&#8221;.</p>



<p>I would rather have nothing in its place than contribute to that.  It is unethical, toxic and harmful to anyone who participates in it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also seen a strange reoccurence of identity politics being worked into the CoC.  I&#8217;m actually a little confused why the LGBTQ+ community is not largely comprised of people offended by the blatant attempt of these corporate-backed projects to introduce identity politics and dog whistles to open source communties as blatant disruption devices to serve those corporate interests, and the CoC is a great place for that to happen.  It is a blatant exploitation of a vulnerable community taking place out of financial interests. </p>



<p>Perhaps my thinking on this may change in the future, but if I were to ever build a community of contributors for, say, SURRO Linux (or what it will actually be called on release), that I might have a CoC that mostly just aimed to prevent political hijacking and offtopic yammer, or interpersonal shit getting mixed with project discussion.</p>



<p>I mean, be gay, trans, bi, straight, whatever you want, but push code and create development roadmaps instead of using this as a platform to validate yourself.  That&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s there for and it&#8217;s oppressive to other demographics.  </p>



<p>In lieu of identity politics and facilitating project hijacking, a CoC that I would want to use would be designed in such a way as to develop, encourage, and reward emotional resilience in members of its community while providing a framework that inclines discussions to be related the project.</p>



<p>That can&#8217;t happen in a safe space or an ideological echo chamber.  Decay can, and does in all cases.</p>



<p>Safe spaces are toxic and harmful.  They are well intended but ultimately detrimental to host and participant as, for the sake of comfort, they stifle the expression of conflicting ideas that drive conceptual evolution in cultural development, which, unless you have a community that has reached an ideological apex&#8211; an Atlantean society of the most perfect expression of viewpoints humanity can ever have with no more room for improvement, then conflicts of ideas have to be permissable for growth of that community (and the broader society it exists in) to take place.</p>



<p> Competing concepts drive cultural evolution, and you can&#8217;t have competing concepts if you forbid or suppress conflict.  This is the nature of people.  This is the nature of ideas.  This is the nature of growth.  Communities that suppress conflict and consequently free expression cannot grow.  Communities that value emotional resilience and a productive manner of conflict can and do&#8211; exclusively.</p>



<p>And then there&#8217;s the out-of-band behaviour.  Too many times I&#8217;ve seen people engaged in conflict who are so emotionally fragile or toxic that they feel they need to go to other platforms to crowdsource a lynching to target people  who have a different perception of reality than they do &#8212; they make up lies about them, and try to use crowds of collaborators to &#8220;shame&#8221; their ideological counterpart which inevitably devolves into extraordinarily toxic harassment by many people, even stalking and offline violence directed at those people who disagree with them (or are triggered by a lie about their target that they believe), or they go after their families, or their careers and reputations.  Anyone who particpates in something like that shouldn&#8217;t be on any project and are a threat to anyone they work with.  The world needs protected from people who do things like that.  I don&#8217;t just mean the people who rally the crowd either, I mean the people who choose to be in the crowd doing the harassment as well.  They are timeless filth.</p>



<p>So, I propose the &#8220;Nobody Cares&#8221; golden principle:  Nobody cares about your poltiical beliefs beyond that you should be allowed to have them.  Nobody cares about your spiritual beliefs beyond that you should be allowed to have them.  Nobody cares about your sexuality or gender identity beyond that you should be allowed to have them.  The same for race, country of origin.  </p>



<p>People would make mistakes occasionally and accidentally care.  They&#8217;re human.  They all have beliefs of their own.  If someone gets a pronoun wrong, or has a belief system that affects which pronouns they use for either themselves or others, then we need to rely on the emotional resilience of everyone participating.  Nobody is forced to alter their speech or beliefs for anyone else.  That also means pejoratives and slurs should not be used.  People who do should be sanctioned.  Personal attacks violate the rule.  And trying to force people to comply with your belief system should count as a personal attack that isn&#8217;t centered on the &#8220;nobody cares&#8221; philosophy:  &#8220;Is the statement about the project or is the statement about someone on the project?&#8221;.  </p>



<p>The caring should be about the project being discussed, not the discussers.  If someone goes on a rampage to try to force everyone&#8217;s beliefs  they can go away and practice their emotional fragility in any of the already existing echo chambers  more than willing to cater to them at the expense of meaningful progress.  I&#8217;ve seen enough.  Nobody cares about the discussers.  They should care about the project and contributions to the project, not whether someone who submitted a pull request donated to the Trump campaign or something stupid they did or said (though I certainly would not be excited to hear about that).  </p>



<p>The only exception to not caring is when someone with a bunch of followers on twitter gets mad because they weren&#8217;t given enough political kowtowing to their identity politics, or are mad about something unrelated that they proceed to shame and lynch, defame, harass, or otherwise harm other contributors on the project.  This also goes for those that take to other platforms for the purpose of stirring up others to do those things.  People that engage in this should be decisively and rapidly ejected.</p>



<p>I also think relying purely on the CoC is a bad call.  It&#8217;s not a framework to push people out, it&#8217;s a framework to help people focus on what they gathered to do.  So, instead of treating it like a legal doctrine, I think right now I would treat it more like a guideline and use my own discretion when handling interpersonal issues or conduct reports to hopefully prevent it from being misused in the way I see other CoC&#8217;s be misused, or sabotaged by trolls.</p></p>

<p>I want to say more, but so much of this is uncharted territory and I want to make sure I underpromise and overdeliver.</p>



<p>Doing this mostly on my own so far has been <strong>bullshit</strong> levels of work lol.</p>



<p>The current build is working with glibc/gcc from raw sources with no crosstool-ng dependency.</p>

                <p><p>Dark Horse Linux is a new Linux distribution owned by SILO GROUP LLC.</p>



<p>Cross-compiling a Linux sysroot, and building the system from upstream sources inside your environment with verified  checksums is about the only way to ensure that software hasn&#8217;t been tampered with.  </p>



<p>That&#8217;s what Dark Horse Linux does to create its sysroot in a publicly verifiable way.  Borrowing largely from the <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">LFS</a> process, Dark Horse Linux is a parent project meant to empower more creators to create their own linux distributions in the course of developing one.</p>



<p>While Dark Horse Linux will eventually move to become a binary package distribution and sell commercial support, it is currently a community effort to re-establish open standards, provide a provably clean OS build, and targets both the container markets as well as research environments.</p>



<p>In order to automate the build process, which is complex, SILO GROUP has developed a new utility called <a href="https://source.silogroup.org/SURRO-Linux/rex" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Rex</a>.  You can read more about Rex on its info page.</p></p>

<h2>9000 Foot View: How Pyrois WorksÂ </h2>



<p>Makefile-driven, Pyrois downloads and compiles our tool, <a href="https://codeberg.org/SILO-GROUP/Rex" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Rex</a>, onto it, and then uses a Rex project to compile a chroot using a cross-compiler.Â  From within that chroot, Rex then compiles all items in the chroot with everything you need for a Linux system.  Pyrois will eventually fork to spawn another project, called Foster, which will preserve that process while it evolves to generate an installer image for a binary package system as part of the genesis of a new Linux Distribution.</p>



<p>As Rex is json-driven, this allows &#8220;checkbox&#8221; style user interfaces to the build steps, allowing almost limitless customization of the Linux distribution that is created by Pyrois.  This will allow you to create very, very small Linux images for specialized use cases.</p>



<p>Pyrois is largely curses dialog-driven and is eager to onboard contributors.</p>



<p>Pyrois is the component that will create Dark Horse Linux.</p></p>
